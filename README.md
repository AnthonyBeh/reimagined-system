# reimagined-system
this an example repository of some documents to show version control in class

We are now adding some text to this document, to see what a small change results in on the repo

## Plan for later

- everyone in class creates their own `repo`
- they edit a markdown file
- they tell denis how amazing this technology is (optional)
