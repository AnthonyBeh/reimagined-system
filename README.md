# reimagined-system

Adding some text to this document, to see what a small change results in on the repo

## Plan for later

- everyone in class creates their own `repo`
- they edit a markdown file
- they tell denis how amazing this technology is (optional)

## Second part of this class

- go back to `FSL` programs and make some nice images / visualisations.
